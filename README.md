# Nowhere Test
Hi!

Thank you for taking your time to apply to the  **Junior Game Developer Intern** position. After reviewing your application, we’re excited to take your application to the next level!

![Hello I'm under construction](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2abc1d_3dac9676f465452abdd8ea28560db679~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_200,h_200,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/steampunk_t%C3%BCccar.png)

Before we invite you to interview for the role, we need you to do a quick task though, we have this small project that needs a bit of reworking. We want you to **fork** this repository and **clone** the project to your computer. Then after fixing everything, we want you to open a **pull request** back to this repository, so we can review your application. Estimated completion time for this task is around 2 hours. Final deadline is 09:00 (AM) 17.04.2023.

- Possible reworks are tagged with TODO comments.
- You are required to follow the coding conventions. ([General C# conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions))
- You may change the editor version (for this task only), if you don't want to download a different editor. This project is made with version 2021.3.21f1. You might have project dependency errors, which can be resolved by updating or downgrading packages after opening the project.
- You may rework more code than what we asked for, but try not to go overboard!
> You may edit our code while reworking, but try not to change some of the methods. Know that changing what we didn't ask for is a risk you are taking.

We’re looking forward to speaking with you.

PS: We couldn't give you a sound sample, unfortunately, you'll have to find a sound file and import it to the project yourself :(
